jQuery-Spaghetti Branch
=======================

This contains the original hackathon version of securesha.re, warts and all.

It has been updated periodically with bugfixes to keep it running.

This is (sadly) the version of the client in live use, as the Polymer version
has had compatibility issues as the Web Components team makes breaking changes
to the spec.
