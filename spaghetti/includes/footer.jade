          li Your browser encrypts the file before handing it to us.
          li You select how many times the file can be accessed or how long it should be available for.
          li We give you a link to share with only the parties you want.
          li They request the file and decrypt it in their browser.
          li We delete the file once it reaches your chosen limits.
          li We are never sent the cipher key - we cannot decrypt your data.
          li No logs are kept.
